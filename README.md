> 
> You can find out more about the conference at {{CONF_LINK}}, or reach out to me directly with any questions.
>
> If you're comfortable with it, we'd really appreciate it if you'd share the CFP with your community.

## Why

In the last five years, i have been managing several communities here in Nigeria, from Google Developer Groups,to Women Tech makers, Forloop Women, Kotlin Nigeria , VR Nigeria Community and alot more but my challenge has been curating female speakers.
Getting this list populated means increasted diversity and better conferences!: **you are welcome here.**
